### CS290 -- Web Development for CS Majors
Winter 2024  
CRN: 33342  
Credits: 4  
Instructor: Joseph Jess  
email: <jessj@linnbenton.edu>

**Initial class note**: We are not in an introduction course to computer science (CS), though that does not mean most of the materials will be difficult.  We will have an intro to various web development technologies and design ideas.  We will assume that we have some programming experience and we will expand on the design, testing, and implementation concepts covered in an introductory CS course.  We need to expect to do a good bit of reading, much practicing, and much discussion of the topics we cover.

### 1. LBCC catalog course description, including pre-requisites/co-requisites:

This course will cover how to design and implement a multi-tier application using Web technologies. This will include the creation of extensive custom client and server side code consistent with achieving a high-quality software architecture.

**Prerequisites**: CS162 Intro to Computer Science II with a grade of “C” or better or equivalent experience as determined by a Computer Systems Department instructor
---

### 2. Class Time-space:
1. **Note**: This class is delivered in a flexible format (you will not need to attend live sessions).
2. **Lecture + demo + lab**: MWF 1000 -- 1120, flexible, see Moodle for details

---

### 3. Measurable student learning outcomes:

On completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of complexity analysis and big O notation.  
2. Analyze and write programming code for numerous searching and sorting algorithms.  
3. Write programming code for linked lists and binary search trees.  
4. Demonstrate an ability to trace code for sorting algorithms using recursion.  
5. Demonstrate an understanding of hash tables, binary trees and multi-way trees.  
I also hope to get practice with the following:  
6. Writing algorithms using pseudocode.  
7. Writing programs using stacks, queues, and graphs.  
8. Demonstrate concepts related to file processing and storage management.

### 4. Learning resources:

1. **Note:** All class materials and storage will be freely available in a digital format
2. The C++ language –  available through several media.  We will discuss this quite a lot in class.
3. A C++ compiler – I will likely use either MSVC or a GNU compatible g++.  We will talk about this in class.
4. I recommend the IDE VSCode, I may use a simpler text editor and the command line to manually write, compile, and run; most editors would be fine.
  1. We will discuss some capabilities of smart code editors during the course.
5. Somewhat regular access to an Internet connection and GitHub (we will cover the GitHub in class!).
6. (**strongly recommended**) A desire to learn, experiment, design, test, and problem solve with code (both on and off of a computer).

---

### 5. Grading:

1. Scores for assignments will be available when the instructor gets to it... usually within a week of the due date. Grades and feedback will be made available through Moodle.
2. Students will be required to turn in all coursework items before 23:59 (Pacific Time Zone) on the date that they are due (generally the first meeting day of the week in my courses)\... though I have an extremely forgiving option for making up for missed work at the end of the term with the final project.
3. To earn a passing grade in this course you must pass each of the following coursework categories:
    1. **Demonstration**: Discussion, quizzes, and weekly assignments and projects -- 50%
        There are a number of discussion questions (usually turned in as a part of the programming projects), quizzes, and programming projects to be completed for this class, designed to challenge and solidify design, coding, and testing skills. Projects are generally graded roughly based on the following rubric:  
        1. **Program Design** (20%)  
            |**Rating** | **Criteria**                                                                 |
            |--------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
            |20       | Solution well thought out                                                      |
            |10       | Solution partially planned out                                                 |
            |0        | ad hoc solution; program was "designed at the keyboard" or no design submitted |
            
        2. **Program Execution** (20%)  
            |**Rating** | **Criteria**                                                                                    |
            |----------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
            |20         | Program runs very well under a variety of conditions, as submitted                              |
            |10         | Program runs much of the time, may be missing required files or instructions for libraries used |
            |0          | Program runs very poorly, not at all, or requires several modifications or files before it runs |
            
        3. **Specification Satisfaction** (20%)  
            |**Rating** | **Criteria**                                             |
            |----------:|----------------------------------------------------------|
            |20         | Program satisfies specification completely and correctly |
            |10         | Important parts of the specification not implemented     |
            |0          | Program poorly satisfies specification, or not at all    |   
            
        4. **Coding Style** (20%)  
            |**Rating** | **Criteria**                                                                                         |
            |----------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
            |20         | Well-formatted, understandable code and appropriate use of language capabilities                     |
            |10         | Code difficult to follow in one reading or poor use of language capabilities                         |
            |0          | Incomprehensible code, poor use of language capabilities, or a need to scroll up and down repeatedly |
            
        5. **Comments and Documentation** (20%)  
            |**Rating** | **Criteria**                                                                                 |
            |----------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
            |20         | Concise, meaningful, and well-formatted comments and other documentation                     |
            |10         | Partial, poorly written, or poorly formatted comments and other documentation                |
            |0          | Wordy, incorrect, badly written or formatted, or none or nearly no comments and documentation|
            
    2. **Final**: Final project design and final project implementation -- 50%
        1. There will be a final project to test the overall ability to understand, design, implement, test, and reflect on the problem solving and programming knowledge and skills covered in the class.
        
        2. The final project will be a mix of "in-class" (initial design, testing, and implementation discussion) and take-home (finalizing design, testing, and implementation) elements.

> **Note**: careful design, systematic testing, consistent style, and readability of code are important software quality factors (all of which are subject to interpretation but graded by the instructor based on the spirit and letter of the requirements, so be sure to explain your decisions).
>
> **Note** **well**: Your submission should be explained and able to be compiled and run from just your submitted files in your final submission for that project. This means that you need to include any files provided to you that are necessary for your project to compile or run, especially mentioning how we get ahold of the version of any third-party libraries that you might link to!
>
> **Note** **very well**: Source code and related documents submitted must be designed and implemented by the student submitting the work and any code must compile and run on one of the instructor\'s machines in order to be graded (to create a working program quickly: get it working simply, then add to it; if at some point it stops compiling you will better know where an error was introduced).
>
> **This means that while you can use tools like tutoring, [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or AI systems to help you learn how to write code, documentation, tests, and designs from various sources, you need to cite that you got help from outside sources (we all keep tabs open to various resources on the web!), and you need to understand what you create and make any code your own.**

4. **Make-up Work**: I do not care when you learn it, as long as you learn it. To support this idea I allow missing work, even after the term for many, to be made up for in the final project (just be sure I know you are trying to make it up in the final project submission!).

5. **Final grades** will be given out based on the following based on score in the class:\
    90-100%: A
    80-89%: B
    70-79%: C
    60-69%: D
    00-59%: F

6. **Reminder**: A passing grade in order to count for course requirements for CS classes is generally a C or above.
